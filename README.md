## Youtube Playlist Time Finder

Replace `<YOUR API KEY>` with the API key you generated from Google and execute this script in any Python interpreter.

When prompted for the playlist URL, you can just enter the YouTube playlist URL. It will give you the total number of videos in that playlist and the combined duration of all videos. You can use this info to estimate the total time required to complete the entire playlist.
